# d3-website

A personal learning project following Yan Holtz's [D3 Loves React](https://www.react-graph-gallery.com/react-d3-dataviz-course) course. This repo is for sharing my progress through the course modules, starting with a basic site hosted on GitHub Pages and I assume will gradually build up a collection of data visualisations created with D3.js and React.

Excited to be part of the first cohort - Feb-Jun 2026

**Course:** [D3 Loves React – Yan Holtz](https://www.react-graph-gallery.com/react-d3-dataviz-course)
